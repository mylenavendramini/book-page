My first website using React. With this project, I put into practice everything I learned about components, hooks, roots and much more. The site is a display of a writer's books and biography. Using React was a good choice to show a page with all the books, another with some categories and another with the book itself.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Home page:
